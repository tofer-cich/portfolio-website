                <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a full-stack developer that's passionate about building clean, 
                efficient applications that solve real problems. 
                I aim to build pixel-perfect UIs, design scalable APIs, and optimize 
                database performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though I'm early in my professional journey, I've immersed myself 
                in front end and back end technologies through hands-on projects 
                and continuous learning. I'm particularly drawn to creating 
                thoughtful user experiences through robust engineering and 
                accesible UIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of development, I'm a lifelong music enthusiast. 
                You'll often find me playing guitar or piano, digging 
                through obscure albums, or curating my growing VHS collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm excited to bring my curiosity, adaptability, 
                and attention to detail to a team that values both 
                innovation and craftsmanship.
            </p>
