            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building clean, 
                efficient applications that solve real problems. 
                With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend 
                technologies, I love the challenge of turning concepts into 
                fully functional productsâ€”whether it's crafting pixel-perfect 
                UIs, designing scalable APIs, or optimizing database performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though I'm early in my professional journey, I've immersed myself 
                in [mention specific areas: e.g., modern JavaScript frameworks, 
                cloud deployment, or database design] through hands-on projects 
                and continuous learning. I'm particularly drawn to [specific interest, 
                e.g., performance optimization, accessibility, or real-time applications], 
                where technical precision meets user-centric design. My goal 
                is to write code that's not just functional but 
                thoughtful--easy to mainain, extend, and understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of development, I'm a lifelong music enthusiast. 
                You'll often find me playing guitar or piano, digging 
                through obscure albums, or curating my growing VHS collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm excited to bring my curiosity, adaptability, 
                and attention to detail to a team that values both 
                innovation and craftsmanship.
            </p>
